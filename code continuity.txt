dijkstra.m - finds distance between any two points

collected points.txt - selected 28 points

model_read_bnd.m - reads those 28 points from file collected points.txt

all_point_geo_dist.m - writes all pair geodesic distance in 'scan_000_dist.txt', and their route in 'scan_000_rout.txt' 

geo_path_show.m - reads model 'scan_000.obj' and it's route 'scan_000_rout.txt'and creates 'scan_000_geo_dist.obj' which visualize the geo distances
